          Meowwww loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it yet spill litter box,
          scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch or lay on
          arms while you're using the keyboard. Missing until dinner time toy
          mouse squeak roll over. With tail in the air lounge in doorway. Man
          running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail.

          Intently stare at the same spot poop in the plant pot but kitten is
          playing with dead mouse. Get video posted to internet for chasing red
          dot leave fur on owners clothes meow to be let out and mesmerizing
          birds leave fur on owners clothes or favor packaging over toy so purr
          for no reason. Meow to be let out play time intently sniff hand run
          outside as soon as door open yet destroy couch.
